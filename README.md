# Telegram dating bot

Created this telegram bot for my friends for them to get in touch with new people.


## Project Files discription:

[meetmeetbot.py](meetmeetbot.py) - the main source file with the code body

[markup.py](markup.py) - file with specialised keyboards for users to get easy with the content

[people.dp](people.dp) - database to store information about users

[work_dp.py](work_dp.py) - template to create basic users

[work_with_db_bot.py](work_with_db_bot.py) - code for bot to work with database data, as it stores on the server online, and I do not have straight access

[images](images/) - folder to store pictures of users
